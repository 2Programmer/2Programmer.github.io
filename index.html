Ralph Baer created the first successful game called <a href = "http://www.ponggame.org/">  "Pong"</a>  which was created in black and white graphics. The kids would play on an atari console with a joystick connected like this: <img src = "images/atari game set.jpg"> 
  the games were not exciting but there was a recreation with different graphics and the same game but called "Tennis" the game had scores on each side <img src = "images/pong.gif"> an the player would try to smack the ball back to the computer generated player, and the person who had 10 points wins. Some Games are used for thinking and designing.
